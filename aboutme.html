      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
       My name is Trufat Admasu, and I am a university student in Addis Ababa currently studying Applied Mathematics. I enjoy learning new concepts especially in math, coding, logic, and emerging technologies. Over time, I’ve also developed strong interest in programming and web development, and I am working to build my skills step-by-step. I like solving problems, exploring innovative ideas, and creating small projects that challenge my thinking. Outside academics, I also enjoy reading, analyzing arguments, and working on business plans, especially those related to entrepreneurship and technology. I am always eager to learn, grow, and take on new opportunities.
